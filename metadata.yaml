description: Reared as a foundling, and apprenticed to an apothecary, Japhet's good
  looks and matchless talent for lying carry him through the guises of tramp, mountebank,
  quack doctor, gentleman-about-town, and finally the only son of a wealthy general.
  Published in 1836, Captain Marryat's picaresque seventh book was his first landlocked"
  story.
